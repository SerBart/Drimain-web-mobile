# DriMain Unification Plan

This document outlines the unified implementation consolidating features from both PR #7 (OpenAPI/Auth/TypeScript) and PR #8 (Department-based access & ROLE_BIURO), along with future enhancement plans.

## Completed Implementation

### ✅ Scope A: OpenAPI / Auth / TypeScript Client

1. **OpenAPI 3.0.3 Specification** (`docs/openapi.yaml`)
   - Complete API documentation for all endpoints
   - Proper security schemes with BearerAuth (JWT)
   - Comprehensive schemas with examples
   - Department-aware authentication responses
   - TODO markers for future parts endpoints

2. **Enhanced Authentication System**
   - Refactored `AuthController` using external DTOs
   - JWT tokens enriched with department claims (deptId, deptName)  
   - UserInfo endpoint `/api/auth/me` with department information
   - Exposed `JwtService.getTtlMinutes()` for token expiration handling

3. **Global Exception Handling**
   - Enhanced `ApiExceptionHandler` with proper `ErrorResponse` format
   - Authentication and authorization exception handling
   - Consistent error responses across all endpoints

4. **TypeScript Client Generation**
   - Root `package.json` with generation scripts
   - Generated TypeScript client with Axios
   - Helper functions for API client configuration
   - Type-safe interfaces for all API models

### ✅ Scope B: Department-based Access & ROLE_BIURO

1. **Data Model Enhancements**
   - Added `User.dzial` relationship with Flyway migration
   - Updated `Zgloszenie` entity with department and author tracking
   - Updated `ZgloszenieStatus` enum (NEW/ACCEPTED/REJECTED/CLOSED)
   - Added audit timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

2. **Access Control Implementation**
   - `ROLE_BIURO`: Global visibility for zgłoszenia, no raporty access
   - Department-based filtering in `ZgloszenieService`
   - Proper access validation with 403 responses
   - Security configuration restricting `/api/raporty/**` to `ROLE_ADMIN`

3. **Repository & Service Layer**
   - `ZgloszenieRepository` with paged department queries
   - `ZgloszenieService` with comprehensive access control logic
   - Department-aware CRUD operations
   - Proper error handling and validation

4. **API Implementation**
   - Real zgłoszenia endpoints replacing placeholders
   - Paginated responses with proper filtering
   - Authentication-aware controllers
   - Department-based data visibility

## Architecture Decisions

### Department Access Model

The implemented access control follows these principles:

```
ROLE_ADMIN    → Full access to all data (raporty + zgłoszenia)
ROLE_BIURO    → Global zgłoszenia access, no raporty access  
ROLE_USER     → Department-restricted zgłoszenia access only
```

### JWT Token Structure

JWT tokens now include department information:
```json
{
  "sub": "username",
  "roles": ["ROLE_USER"],
  "deptId": 1,
  "deptName": "IT Department",
  "iat": 1640995200,
  "exp": 1640998800
}
```

### API Response Patterns

All endpoints follow consistent patterns:
- Paginated list responses using `PageDTO<T>`
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404)
- Structured error responses with `ErrorResponse` schema
- Department information included in relevant DTOs
