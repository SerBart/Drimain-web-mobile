# Unification Plan - Drimain Web & Mobile

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for unifying Drimain's web and mobile applications through a monorepo approach.

## Overview

The unification process is divided into phases (waves) to ensure controlled, incremental progress while maintaining system stability.

## Milestones & Waves

#### Risk: Package interdependency issues

**Mitigation**:

- Clear package boundaries and interfaces
- Dependency graph monitoring
- Regular dependency audits

#### Risk: Performance degradation

**Mitigation**:

- Performance benchmarks in CI
- Regular load testing
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### Timeline Risks

#### Risk: Scope creep

**Mitigation**:

- Clear acceptance criteria for each wave
- Regular stakeholder reviews
- Change request process

#### Risk: Resource constraints

**Mitigation**:

- Flexible wave boundaries
- Priority-based feature implementation
- Technical debt management
