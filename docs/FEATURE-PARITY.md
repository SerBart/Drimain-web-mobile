# Feature Parity Matrix

## Overview
This document tracks feature parity between web and mobile applications throughout the unification process.

## Wave 1 Status: Foundation Complete ✅

**Note**: Wave 1 focused on establishing the monorepo foundation and migrating the web application. Mobile feature analysis will be conducted in Wave 2 (PR #3).

### Infrastructure & Tooling

| Feature | Web (apps/web) | Mobile (TBD) | Status | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------------|---------|-------|
| Monorepo Structure | ✅ | ⏳ | Partial | Web migrated, mobile planned |
| Shared Design Tokens | ✅ | ⏳ | Partial | CSS generated, React Native pending |
| Shared Domain Models | ✅ | ⏳ | Partial | Zod schemas ready, mobile integration pending |
| Development Scripts | ✅ | ⏳ | Partial | Web scripts configured |
| Build Process | ✅ | ⏳ | Partial | Maven for web, mobile TBD |
| Testing Framework | ✅ | ⏳ | Partial | Java/TestNG for web |

### Core Application Features

**Note**: Detailed feature parity analysis will be completed during mobile migration (PR #3). This section provides a foundation for that analysis.

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **Web**: Spring Security with JWT, role-based access
- **Mobile**: TBD (will be analyzed in PR #3)

#### Core Business Logic
- **Web**: Reports, schedules, inventory, user management
- **Mobile**: TBD (scope to be determined)

#### Data Management  
- **Web**: JPA with H2/database, REST API
- **Mobile**: TBD (likely REST API consumer)

## Shared Package Integration Status

### @drimain/core-domain
- ✅ **Package Created**: Zod schemas for User, Report entities
- ✅ **Web Integration**: Conceptual demonstration implemented
- ⏳ **Mobile Integration**: Planned for PR #3
- ⏳ **Validation Logic**: Runtime validation to be implemented

### @drimain/design-tokens
- ✅ **Package Created**: Token system with CSS generation
- ✅ **Web Integration**: CSS imported in templates
- ⏳ **Mobile Integration**: React Native StyleSheet generation planned
- ⏳ **Theme Variants**: Dark/light modes to be implemented

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Current Limitations (to be addressed in future PRs)
- [ ] OpenAPI specification placeholder (PR #2b)
- [ ] Client-side TypeScript validation
- [ ] Cross-platform testing strategy
- [ ] Mobile application analysis and integration
- [ ] Advanced tooling (lint, format, commit hooks)

### Quality Metrics (Baseline)
- **Web Application**: Functional Spring Boot app with Thymeleaf
- **Shared Packages**: Basic implementation, ready for extension
- **Build Process**: Working for web, mobile integration pending
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive for current scope
