# Feature Parity Analysis - Web vs Mobile

## Overview

This document tracks feature parity between web and mobile applications to ensure consistent user experience across platforms.

## Current Status

**API baseline established** - Core authentication and user management endpoints implemented in OpenAPI specification.

## Core Features

### Authentication
- [ ] **Login** - Email/password authentication
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented  
  - API: ✅ POST /auth/login

- [ ] **Registration** - User account creation
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ POST /auth/register

- [ ] **Logout** - Session termination
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ POST /auth/logout

- [ ] **Token Refresh** - Automatic session renewal
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ POST /auth/refresh

### User Management
- [ ] **Profile View** - Display user information
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ GET /users/me

- [ ] **Profile Edit** - Update user information
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ PATCH /users/me

### Profile Management
- [ ] **My Profile View** - Display extended profile
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ GET /profiles/me

- [ ] **Profile Edit** - Update profile information
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ PATCH /profiles/me

- [ ] **Other Profiles** - View public profiles
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ GET /profiles/{userId}

### Notifications
- [ ] **Notification Preferences** - Manage notification settings
  - Web: Not yet implemented
  - Mobile: Not yet implemented
  - API: ✅ Part of Profile model

## Platform-Specific Features

### Web Only
- [ ] **Admin Panel** - Administrative interface
- [ ] **Bulk Operations** - Multi-item management
- [ ] **Advanced Search** - Complex filtering options

### Mobile Only
- [ ] **Push Notifications** - Real-time alerts
- [ ] **Biometric Authentication** - Fingerprint/Face ID
- [ ] **Offline Support** - Limited offline functionality

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Functionality ✅
- [x] API endpoints for authentication and user management
- [x] Generated TypeScript client
- [x] Model synchronization validation

### Phase 2: Web Implementation
- [ ] Authentication flows
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Basic UI components

### Phase 3: Mobile Implementation  
- [ ] Authentication flows
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Native UI components
- [ ] Push notification setup

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Real-time features
- [ ] Advanced user management
- [ ] Platform-specific optimizations

## Technical Considerations

### Shared Components
- API client library (`@drimain/api-client`)
- Type definitions (from OpenAPI spec)
- Authentication logic patterns
- Error handling strategies

### Platform Differences
- **Web**: Browser-based, cookies/localStorage for tokens
- **Mobile**: Native app, secure storage for tokens
- **API**: Same endpoints, different client implementations

## Testing Strategy

### API Testing
- ✅ Smoke tests for generated client
- [ ] Integration tests with backend
- [ ] E2E API testing

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for components
- [ ] Integration tests for flows
- [ ] Cross-platform consistency tests

## Maintenance Notes

- Keep this document updated as features are implemented
- Use `pnpm verify-model-sync` to check API model consistency
- Regular parity reviews during development cycles
- Platform-specific features should be clearly documented
